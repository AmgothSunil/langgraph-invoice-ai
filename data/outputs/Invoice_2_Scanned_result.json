There is no PO match and the PO match confidence is also 0.0. With no extracted fields, no discrepancies to evaluate, and no way to verify the invoice against a purchase order, the situation falls into the low-confidence, high-risk category that requires human intervention. Therefore, the appropriate action is to escalate to a human reviewer."
